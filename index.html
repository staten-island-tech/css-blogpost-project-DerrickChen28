        <p>When people think of smoothies, this combination of fruit is definitely one that comes to mind. Smoothies
            are to enjoy on a nice hot day outside, and lets be honest, mango and pineapple make such a good pair to
            simulate a nice sandy beach day in Honolulu, Hawaii. </p>

            <h2>2. Strawberry and Banana</h2>
            <h5>Two very popular fruits sound like a strnage combination at first, but together they make a truly
                sensational flavor of smoothie, Sep 21,
                2021</h5>

        </div>
        <p>These very different fruits were very suprising to people when they initially try a strawberry banana
            smoothie.The richness of the banana actually complements the bursting sweetness of a ripe strawberry very
            well.It's definitely a classic flavor people resort too, which is why it made it on this list.</p>

            <h2>3. Very Berry</h2>
            <h5>Very Berry is typically a mix of your favorite fruits. This smoothies won't be overwhelmingly sweet, but
                it'll for sure be packed with flavor!, Sep 22, 2022</h5>

        <p>The Verry Berry smoothie is one you can find in plenty of establishments. This is the smoothie for you if you
            are extremely indecisive in choosing. The variety of fruits it contains usually makes up for missing out on
            the rest of the smoothie. It's got some of my favorite fruits, ranging from blackberries to acai. </p>
